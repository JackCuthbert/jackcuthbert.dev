# TypeScript & React Things I Wish I Knew Earlier

During my quest to master TypeScript and React I've discovered some super
helpful type definitions and syntax along the way that I wish I knew earlier.

## React.FC

I had no idea this was a thing for so long that it's kind of embarrassing to
admit. It took me some `ctrl + click` (or `gd` for the [Vimmasterrace](https://gitlab.com/JackCuthbert/dotfiles/tree/master/config/nvim))
spelunking in my editor to discover my new favourite type, `React.FC`. All the
following examples are _effectively_ equal.

```tsx
const MyComponent = (props: Props) => {
  /* ... */
}
const MyComponent: React.FunctionComponent<Props> = props => {
  /* ... */
}
const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = props => {
  /* ... */
}
function MyComponent(props: Props): JSX.Element {
  /* ... */
}
```

> To get the nice types around `props.children` you should use the `React.FC`
> type assertion even though the variations without it still work.

## React.ChangeEvent & React.MouseEvent

`React.SyntheticEvent` was my go-to type definition for all my event handler
parameters. While this worked well for some time, I resorted to using overly
verbose runtime type narrowing and generally messy handler functions just to
make the compiler stop yelling at me.

It would've looked something like this when using the older class component
style.

```tsx {2}
class MyInput extends React.Component {
  handleClick (event: React.SyntheticEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) {
    // do the thing with the stuff
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}></button>
    )
  }
}
```

Change events can use the `React.ChangeEvent<T>` type where `T` is the type of
element triggering the handler. This will work on all `<input>` elements,
checkboxes too! Just be careful to have your runtime checks ensure that your
handler is attached to the right kind of element.

```tsx {4}
import React, { useCallback, FC, ChangeEvent } from 'react'

const Input: FC<Props> = ({ onChange }) => {
  const handleChange = useCallback((event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    // do the thing with the stuff
  })

  return <input onChange={handleChange} />
}
```

When using a click handler, React passes up the event parameter as a
`React.MouseEvent<T>` â€“ again `T` is the type of element triggering the handler.

```tsx {4}
import React, { useCallback, FC, MouseEvent } from 'react'

const Input: FC<Props> = ({ onChange }) => {
  const handleClick = useCallback((event: MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
    // do the thing with the stuff
  })

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</button>
}
```

## Generic function components

In a very contrived example you can tell TypeScript to use a generic with a
function component in TSX using the `function` keyword syntax. I've typically
used this method to wrap higher order components that pass through specific
object shapes to its children.

First, define your function with a generic as if you were writing a non-TSX
function.

```tsx
interface Props<T> {
  items: T[]
}

function MyComponent<T>({ items }: Props<T>) {
  return props.children({ genericItems: items })
}
```

Then pass in whatever type of entity you like! The [Render Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)
(in this case) will now know what properties are available on `genericItems` as
it's being inferred by `MyComponent`. This is of course a very contrived example
and your actual implementations may well be a lot more useful than this one.

```tsx {11}
const items = [
  { name: 'one' },
  { name: 'two' }
]

const MyView: React.FC = () => (
  <MyComponent items={items}>
    {({ genericItems }) => {
      <ul>
        {/* item.name is totally valid here with asserting types :O */}
        {genericItems.map(item => <li>{item.name}</li>}
      </li>
    }}
  </MyComponent>
)
```

## Closing thoughts

TypeScript with React continues to be a joy to write, especially when armed with
editors like Visual Studio Code that provide easy ways to navigate your way
through type definitions with a single shortcut. It's definitely made my
day-to-day far more productive and my code much cleaner.
