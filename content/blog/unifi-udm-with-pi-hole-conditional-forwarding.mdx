I've recently had to redo my home networking after moving, and I finally decided
to pick up the Unifi UDM instead of a bunch of disparate Unifi devices that
seemed to break down when I try to update or manage any of them.

This guide details how to both configure Pi-hole with the UDM and enable
Conditional Forwarding for nice hostnames in the Pi-hole UI. It should also work
with an up-to-date USG, Cloud Key, or other Unifi Controller on your network.

> The following assumes you've already set up the Pi-hole server on a static IP
in your network.

## 1. UDM: Set upstream DNS

On the UDM, you'll need to set the DNS servers just like you would without a
Pi-hole.

In the new UI it's *Settings*, *Internet*, *WAN* (or whatever you've named your
internet connection), *Advanced*, *DNS Server*. Set these values to whatever you
like, [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) or [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net/)
are good options.

## 2. UDM: Advertise Pi-hole DNS

Next, we'll tell the DHCP server(s) that the UDM runs to advertise the Pi-hole's
static IP address as the DNS server.

In the new UI for **IPv4** it's:

1. Settings
2. Networks
3. LAN (or the name you've chosen for your network(s))
4. Advanced
5. DHCP Name Server: **Change to Manual**
6. DNS Server 1: **Change to the static Pi-hole IP address**

In the new UI for **IPv6** it's very similar to IPv4, follow steps 1â€”4 and
scroll _all_ the way to the bottom.

1. Settings, Networks, LAN, Advanced (as above)
2. Scroll until the end of time
3. Ensure IPv6 is enabled via Interface Type (my ISP uses Prefix Delegation) and RA
4. DHCPv6/RDNSS DNS Control: **Change to Manual**
5. DNS Server 1: **Change to the Pi-hole IPv6 address**

## 3. Pi-hole: Set upstream DNS

Next, we'll change **all** the upstream DNS servers in Pi-hole to __only__ the
router's address, typically `192.168.1.1`. Your settings panel should look
something like this.

I automate this with the following Docker Compose file:

```yaml:compose.yml showLineNumbers {15,19}
version: '3.8'

services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - '53:53/tcp'
      - '53:53/udp'
      - '8053:80/tcp' # access Pi-hole UI on this port
    environment:
      TZ: 'Australia/Melbourne'
      WEBPASSWORD: 'SOME_PASSWORD'
      PIHOLE_DNS_: '192.168.1.1'               # set to router upstream
      FTLCONF_REPLY_ADDR4: '192.168.1.xx'      # ipv4 of Pi-hole server
      FTLCONF_REPLY_ADDR6: 'XXXX:x00:000X::00' # ipv6 of Pi-hole server
    dns:
      - '127.0.0.1'
    volumes:
      - ./pihole/etc/pihole/:/etc/pihole/
      - ./pihole/etc/dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
```

> Line 19 is an interesting one. I needed to set this to prevent Pi-hole from
using a default list of DNS servers on startup.


## 4. Pi-hole: Enable Conditional Forwarding

Lastly, if you want the full hostnames reported in the Pi-hole UI instead of
the IP addresses you'll need to enable conditional forwarding.

To do this you need to make sure that:

1. both the `FTLCONF_REPLY_ADDR4` and `FTLCONF_REPLY_ADDR6` environment variables are set for your Pi-hole server
2. you've found the local domain name from the UDM (Settings, Networks, LAN, Advanced, Domain Name)

Then, head to the Pi-hole DNS settings and all the way at the bottom you can
enable Conditional Forwarding with your local network details. Mine looks like
this:

  width={696}
/>

## Check it works

If everything went well you should be able to restart/reconnect your network
adapters/services and the UDM DHCP server should advertise that the Pi-hole IP
is the DNS server IP, the Pi-hole will start to get hostnames from your router,
and your blocked domains will continue to be blocked!

If you're using `systemd-resolved` like me, you can use `resolvectl` to check
which DNS servers are in use.
