Everyone knows the meme about the size of the `node_modules` folder so I'll try to make this one quick. You can (in some cases) drastically reduce the size of a resulting docker image by avoiding the inclusion of non-production node modules.

## Create a builder image

This is an easy one, and probably something you're already used to doing. Create a Dockerfile as you would normally but this time we'll add an `as` keyword. This essentially creates a name for the current image in the `FROM` line.

```docker{1}
FROM node:8-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app

COPY src/ ./src
COPY package* ./
COPY tsconfig.json ./

RUN npm install
RUN npm run build
```

## Install your production dependencies

We're also going to use the same `as` keyword in this image to tell the final image where to get the production dependencies from.

```docker{1}
FROM node:10-alpine as dependencies
WORKDIR /app

# Copy over the original package.json, we need this to npm install!
COPY --from=builder /app/package* ./

RUN npm install --production
```

## Compose your final image

Now we can **reference the previous images** using the `--from` argument _* gasps *_. This means we can compose a final image from all the previous stages **without** the `node_modules` bloat.

```docker{5,8,11}
FROM node:10-alpine
WORKDIR /app

# Copy over our built application code
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

# Copy over the original package.json so we know how to start it
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json .

# Copy over our hopefully much lighter node_modules folder
COPY --from=dependencies /app/node_modules ./node_modules

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

Putting **all three** snippets together in a **single Dockerfile** should achieve a much thinner image now that we're not including all our development dependencies as well.
