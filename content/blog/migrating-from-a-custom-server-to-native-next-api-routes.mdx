# Migrating from a custom server to native Next.js API routes

At [Bueno](https://www.buenosystems.com.au/) we deploy our applications to GCP
via Pulumi and Kubernetes (need more buzzwords?). When we first started building
our applications with Next.js we knew we needed to proxy any API requests to our
existing Spring + Kotlin backend service and a way to check if the apps are
healthy in our k8s clusters.

Historically this could be done with either a [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server)
and some middleware or [Next.js rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites).
Recently we've been able to completely remove the custom server while retaining
an API proxy and support for a k8s readiness probe.

## How we did it before

At the time we started building our first Next.js app, [Next.js rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites)
didn't exist so we went down the complete custom server route with:

1. [a custom express server](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/main/examples/custom-server-express)
   with [express-actuator](https://github.com/rcruzper/express-actuator) and
   [express-http-proxy](https://github.com/villadora/express-http-proxy) middleware
2. [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) and a second `tsconfig.server.json` file to
   manage the compilation of our custom server for development
3. Additional build scripts and `Dockerfile` steps to package up the custom
   server

The combination of which ended up making our application far more complex to
maintain than we'd like, slower to start, and slightly more difficult to package
up for k8s.

## How we do it now

Without a custom server of course!

### The proxy

For the proxy we've made use of the widely used package
[node-http-proxy](https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy)
and a custom Next.js API route at `/api` which forwards all requests to our
proxy target configured by a `process.env.API_HOST` variable.

> package which we had to replace due to a serious memory leak issue resulting
> in server restarts. The following achieves the same functionality without the
> memory leak.

Install the proxy library:

```shell
npm install --save http-proxy
```

Then create a catch-all route at `/api`:

```ts:./src/pages/api/[...proxy].ts
import httpProxy from 'http-proxy'
import { type NextApiHandler } from 'next'

// We add support for path rewrites by extending the default options
interface Config extends httpProxy.ServerOptions {
  rewritePath: {
    pattern: string
    replace: string
  }
}

// First we create a function that creates our handler and proxy instance
function setupProxy({ rewritePath, ...config }: Config): NextApiHandler {
  const proxy = httpProxy.createProxy(config)

  return (req, res) => {
    // here we replace the URL that's passed through to the proxy web handler
    // with the rewrite that we've defined
    const exp = new RegExp(rewritePath.pattern)
    req.url = req.url?.replace(exp, rewritePath.replace)

    proxy.web(
      req,
      res,
      {
        changeOrigin: true,
        ...config
      },
      // NOTE: You _must_ handle any errors here as the http-proxy package does
      // not handle them for you. This will not affect any downstream severs
      // returning status codes >=400, only errors communicating with downstream
      // servers are handled here.
      // We've found a 500 code with a simple message here adequate.
      error => {
        console.error(error)
        res.status(500)
        res.send(error.message)
      }
    )
  }
}

// Then we call to configure it and create the function which is exported as normal
export default setupProxy({
  target: 'http://my.api.url:1337',
  rewritePath: {
    pattern: '^/api',
    replace: ''
  }
})
```

The `externalResolver: true` config property here is to prevent Next.js from
warning us about possible stalled requests. Next has some internal checks to
ensure that any `/api` route returns some data. We're effectively bypassing this
completely by using a proxy server and Next.js is (correctly) freaking out about
it.

Without this config Next will warn you about potentially stalled requests.

### A note on Next.js rewrites

At the time of writing the `rewrites` property in Next.js does not support
runtime configuration via `process.env` variables. This made it a non-starter
for us as we need to be able to configure our proxy target URL well after the
app is built and deployed to a cluster.

### The actuator

Because we use Pulumi and K8S to orchestrate our infrastructure we need a way to
determine if our apps are up ([via readiness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/)).
Originally we used the [express-actuator](https://github.com/rcruzper/express-actuator)
middleware in the custom server from earlier to provide some Spring-style
actuator endpoints. In order to remove the custom server we need to write those
same endpoints but this time with native Next.js API routes.

We've open soured [@bueno-systems/next-actuator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bueno-systems/next-actuator)
to do exactly that for you!

Install it with:

```shell
npm install --save @bueno-systems/next-actuator
# or
yarn add @bueno-systems/next-actuator
```

Then in your Next.js application it's as simple as:

```ts:./src/pages/api/actuator/[...actuator].ts
import nextActuator from '@bueno-systems/next-actuator'

export default nextActuator()
```

This will set up api routes for:

- `GET /api/actuator/health`
- `GET /api/actuator/info`
- `GET /api/actuator/metrics`

For more information on usage, responses, and possible configuration,
[see the code on GitHub](https://github.com/bueno-systems/next-actuator).

## Closing thoughts

Not only did we remove more dependencies than we added when we originally built
this functionality into our app we also saw gains in developer experience by:

- Reduced complexity in packaging and deployment
- Reducing dev mode boot times
- Allowing our devs to create custom API endpoints or mock APIs in the Next.js
  way without extra dependencies either in code or on our backend team

We (as a company) have also released our first open source library that is truly
useful that I'll personally be using in my own Next.js projects in the future.
