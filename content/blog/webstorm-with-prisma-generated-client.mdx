# WebStorm with Prisma's Generated Client

Something I've been struggling with this week is my new favourite editor,
WebStorm, not playing nice with a generated Prisma client. Searching for
solutions doesn't yield much outside a few GitHub issues (that didn't help)

If anyone else found this post after giving up on WebStorm and going back to VS
Code simply **mark the generated `.prisma` directory as _not excluded_** in WebStorm,
then restart the IDE. WebStorm should then pick up the appropriate type
definitions from the generated client.

Thanks Elena Pogorelova for [this wonderful JetBrains forum post](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360009385399-Go-to-declaration-auto-import-doesn-t-work-in-certain-situations).
