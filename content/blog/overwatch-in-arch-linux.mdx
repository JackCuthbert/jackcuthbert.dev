Gaming on Linux has certainly come a long way since I first tried it under
Ubuntu years ago â€“ so much so that I'm now playing games on Linux 90% of the
time. For the other 10% of my time I'm dual booting back into Windows 10 if I
absolutely have to.

## Lutris

First, we're going to need [Lutris](https://lutris.net). Lutris is an open
source gaming platform for Linux. At a lower level, it's a collection of curated
scripts to install and run games that do not support Linux natively.

Thankfully Lutris is in the main repo under Arch Linux so installation is
simple, for other distributions see [their installation page](https://lutris.net/downloads/).

```bash
sudo pacman -S lutris
```

## DXVK

DXVK is a Vulkan based implementation of Direct3D 10/11 that runs on Linux/Wine.
This is required for many Windows-only games and Lutris will manage most of this
for us, all _we_ need to do is install Wine (staging) and some Vulkan
dependencies.

```bash
sudo pacman -S wine-staging vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader
```

Once these are installed, boot up Lutris and install Overwatch via the search
box!
