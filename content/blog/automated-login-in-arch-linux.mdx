Now that I'm using Arch Linux + i3-gaps everywhere with encrypted installs
logging in _after_ typing my encryption password has become slow and annoying.
With the following steps you'll only have to type your encryption password
during boot and the rest of the system will start up as normal.

Create a directory named `getty@tty1.service.d/` inside the systemd system unit
files directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/
```

Create a file in this folder called `override.conf` with the following content:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/override.conf
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/usr/bin/agetty --autologin YOUR_USERNAME_HERE --noclear %I $TERM
```

That's it! On next reboot, it will skip the tty1 login step and go straight to
your window manager.
