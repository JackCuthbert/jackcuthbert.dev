# Serverless and Slack

In the early days of building out [Kaomoji.moe](https://kaomoji.moe/) I was
learning about the [Serverless framework](https://serverless.com/) and the
benefits around being able to simply write code without worrying about
deployments, security, or infrastructure planning.

## The problem

Serverless framework promised me super scalable and encapsulated functions that
could be deployed in seconds. So this is what I did; I built my app with this
idea that Serverless was the way to go. Kaomoji.moe was originally built as 3â€“4
functions that dealt with everything: OAuth, slash commands, event
subscriptions, you name it.

Slack has a hard requirement of responding to any slash command in under 3
seconds. No matter what I did to optimise the cold-start time or the speed of my
code, I simply could not create a consistent Serverless endpoint (via AWS
Lambda) that returned a result quick enough. Many of the responses were
perfectly fine, but my users were often complaining about timeout issues in
their commands. This is not great for user experience.

## The "solution"

Kaomoji is now written as an always-on Koa server (deployed by GitLab CI and AWS
Elastic Beanstalk) that can consistently respond in less than a second. It's
also been a great way to extract some repetitive actions like verifying Slack
requests and retrieving user information into isolated and testable middleware
functions.

I think Serverless has a place at massive scale, until then for a fast slash
command experience, stick with traditional Node.js servers.
